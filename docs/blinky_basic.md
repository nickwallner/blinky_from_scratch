# Basic Blinky

*Before you start this section, make sure you've read section on writing startup code for
our mcu. Each section builds upon the last, so its helpful to read them in order.*

We've written some basic startup code that we can use to initialize our mcu to the proper
state to begin executing our project code. Now, its time to write some project code! We will start
with the bare minimum to blink an LED, and then add features from there.

To be successful in this section, you'll need to have a basic understanding of bitwise
operations in C.
